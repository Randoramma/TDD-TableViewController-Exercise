# TDD-TableViewController-Exercise
Nerd Ranch tutorial followed using TDD principles.  

My current interest (one of which) is to learn TDD.  I have worked through Dr. Dominik Hauser's book TDD with Swift but have been unable to source a decent book on TDD using Objective C.  I have decided the first attempt at this will be to work through some of the tutorials in iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide as if they were designs.  

I am interested in feedback on this project.  

The idea is that this is an application taht keeps an inventory of possessions.  The ideas is to become familiar with the UITableViewController, its Datasource and custom TableView Cells.  

I have added to this Test Driven Development in the best way which I understand it.  I acknowledge that not all of this was done correctly (currently I have set a deadline for myself to finish this project rapidly and so some of the elements that the project pulls from previous chapters within the book have been borrowed without fully testing.  I have tried to focus on testing some of the more interesting and (what I consider complex) testing elements. 

* testing the basic TableView Controller 
* testing the singleton (and mocking it) 
*
